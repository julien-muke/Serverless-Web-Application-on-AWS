## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency


‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create an Amazon S3 Bucket

First, you need to create an Amazon S3 bucket where you will store your objects.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region in which you want to create a bucket.
